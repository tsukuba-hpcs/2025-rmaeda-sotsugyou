	abstract = {This paper proposes a design for CHFS, an ad hoc parallel file system that utilizes the persistent memory of compute nodes. The design is based entirely on a highly scalable distributed key-value store with consistent hashing. CHFS improves the scalability of parallel data-access performance and metadata performance in terms of the number of compute nodes by eliminating dedicated metadata servers, sequential execution, and centralized data management. The implementation efficiently utilizes multicore and manycore CPUs, high-performance networks, and remote direct memory access by the Mochi-Margo library. With a 4-node persistent memory cluster, CHFS performs 9.9 times better than the state-of-the-art DAOS distributed object storage and 6.0 times better than GekkoFS on the IOR hard write benchmark. Regarding scalability, CHFS displays better scalability and performance for both bandwidth and metadata compared with BeeOND and GekkoFS. CHFS is a promising building block for HPC storage layers.},

	abstract = {We present GekkoFS, a temporary, highly-scalable burst buffer file system which has been specifically optimized for new access patterns of data-intensive High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications. The file system provides relaxed POSIX semantics, only offering features which are actually required by most (not all) applications. It is able to provide scalable I/O performance and reaches millions of metadata operations already for a small number of nodes, significantly outperforming the capabilities of general-purpose parallel file systems.},
